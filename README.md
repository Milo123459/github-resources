**Try and respond as fast as you can to make sure that people don't think the project is dead.** - If people can get help with the project sooner, that means they will think better of the community.

**Listen to everyone's opinion.** - If you think something doesn't mean that you are 100% correct.

## PR rules

**Make sure to read the contributing guidelines. (If they exist)** - This will mean that you don't have to re-do abunch of contributed code.

... and all the discussion rules.
